# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
This is the repository for the course project for Getting and Cleaning Data in Coursera.

The project includes an R file to create a tidy data set according the the course project criteria in several steps:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The data used can be found in:

More information on the data can be found in:

The script expects that file (the compressed data) to be present on the working directory.
